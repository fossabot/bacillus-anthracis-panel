title: "Boxplot showing the proportion of *B. anthracis* sequencing depth divided by the depth at conserved *Bacillus* markers for a collection of metagenomic samples containing *B. anthracis* at a variety of spike-in levels. These synthetic datasets are the same as those depicted in [Figure 6](#figure-6). The amount of spiked-in near neighbor remains constant over this series of samples (150K reads). In the absence of the near neighbor (bottom panel) the proportion of *B. anthracis* / all *Bacillus* remains relatively constant, across the range of spike-in amounts. In the presence of the near neighbor (top panel), this proportion of *B. anthracis* / all *Bacillus* increases with the amount of *B. anthracis* added to the sample. At the lowest level of *B. anthracis* spike-in (0.1X), the proportion of estimated sequencing depth for *B. anthracis* compared to all _Bacillus_ in the samples ranges from 0.005â€“0.008, much above the rate expected due to sequencing error. Note that the vertical axis is not shared between the two panels in this figure. "
