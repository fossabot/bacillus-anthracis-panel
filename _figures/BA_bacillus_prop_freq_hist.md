title: "Frequency histogram showing the ratio of sequencing depth at *B. anthracis* core genome markers divided by the sequencing depth at conserved *Bacillus* markers.  *B. anthracis* isolates ranged from 18% - 81%, reflecting a range of conservation across the core genome and sequencing quality. The other *Bacillus* isolates ranged from 0% - 0.09% -- consistent with low-level sequencing error."
