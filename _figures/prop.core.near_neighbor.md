title: "Boxplot showing the proportion of *B. anthracis* core genome markers detected for a collection of metagenomic samples containing *B. anthracis* at a variety of spike-in levels. These synthetic datasets were constructed on a background on 5M soil reads (SRR351473). Half of the datasets contain 150K reads (~10X sequencing depth) from a near neighbor (*B. thuringensis*), which does not impact the proportion of *B. anthracis* markers detected. "
